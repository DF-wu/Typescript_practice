# Learning Plan Folder

Use this folder to track plan, execution, and review history.

## Files

- `study-roadmap.md`: stage-by-stage plan and milestone goals
- `progress-tracker.md`: daily/weekly task progress with checkboxes
- `review-log.md`: feedback history after each submission review
- `session-notes.md`: short handoff notes for context continuity

## Workflow

1. Open `progress-tracker.md` and mark the current task as in-progress.
2. Finish code in your own environment.
3. Submit with `docs/submission-template.md`.
4. Record review feedback in `review-log.md`.
5. Update next action in `session-notes.md`.
